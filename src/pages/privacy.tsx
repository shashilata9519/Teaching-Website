          Like all websites, we use other companies, agents or contractors

          us in providing services to you. We engage these Service Providers to
          provide marketing, advertising, communications, infrastructure and IT
          services. Besides these functions, they are critical for other
          capacities such as to personalize and optimize our service, to process
          credit card transactions or other payment methods, to provide customer
          service, to collect debts, to analyse and enhance data (including data
          about users’ interactions with our service), and to process and
          administer consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services,

          agents and subcontractors to help us with any of our uses of your data
          set out in our Privacy Policy such as for authentication or to avoid
